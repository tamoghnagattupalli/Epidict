Epidict Research Paper


Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes recurring, unprovoked seizures due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. It affects people of all ages and can vary widely in severity and type of seizures. While medication helps many manage their symptoms, about one-third of patients have drug-resistant epilepsy. The condition can impact daily life, safety, and mental health, and it often carries social stigma. Being able to predict seizures could greatly improve quality of life by helping individuals avoid dangerous situations, reduce anxiety, and better manage their condition.
 Epidict is a seizure predicting device tracking the neurotransmitters IL-6 and glutamate found within the body. These two compounds are neurotransmitters instrumental in the regulation of the nervous systems and there are a couple of common changes that happen before all types of seizures. Any of the possible hormones and neurotransmitters below could be used:

Biosensor Technology and Target Analytes
Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) have inspired the concept of analogous biosensors for neurotransmitters and inflammatory markers. The proposed system involves microneedle-based sensors that penetrate the skin (~1-2 mm) to access interstitial fluid (ISF), which contains measurable concentrations of glutamate, melatonin, and IL-6.
Glutamate and melatonin are small molecules with relatively high concentrations in ISF, enabling near-real-time monitoring with electrochemical enzyme or aptamer-based sensors.
IL-6, a larger cytokine protein, presents challenges due to lower concentrations and slower kinetics, typically requiring more complex immunoassays or sensitive aptamer-based detection.
Sensor design includes separate modules: a combined glutamate and melatonin sensor patch for high-frequency (e.g., every 20 seconds) measurement and a dedicated IL-6 sensor operating at lower frequency (e.g., every 5 to 15 minutes). Microneedle arrays ensure minimally invasive, continuous access to ISF without penetrating blood vessels or nerves.

Ethical Considerations in Preclinical Research
Animal models, particularly mice, are commonly used to validate seizure-prediction technologies. Inducing seizures in mice can be ethically justified under strict guidelines if it advances scientific knowledge and potential human benefits, provided procedures minimize suffering and are approved by institutional animal care and use committees (IACUC).

App Development and Machine Learning Integration
A companion smartphone app is essential for user interface, data visualization, alarm notification, and remote monitoring. Developing a fully featured app with cloud storage and machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve seizure prediction accuracy may cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars when outsourced.
A basic app with features like seizure alarms, countdown timers, current and historical analyte levels, and developer data access can be developed personally using free development tools (e.g., Flutter, React Native). The primary investment would be time, developer accounts (~$124/year), and optional cloud hosting fees.
Machine learning integration requires labeled seizure event data and biosensor inputs to train predictive models, demanding significant data science expertise and infrastructure.

Data Management Using AP Computer Science A Knowledge
Fundamental programming skills taught in AP Computer Science A (Java-based) provide a strong foundation for handling local data storage, simple data structures, file I/O, and implementing basic alarm logic within the app. Collaborating with or learning from an AP CSA teacher can assist in developing efficient data saving and retrieval methods.
Advanced features such as cloud integration, real-time Bluetooth communication, and ML require expanding beyond AP CSA fundamentals, possibly involving additional coursework or partnerships.

Conclusion
Developing a seizure-predicting biosensor system combining advanced microneedle ISF sensing, user-friendly apps, and intelligent machine learning holds transformative potential. While technical challenges and costs exist, strategic sensor design, ethical preclinical research, incremental app development, and leveraging programming knowledge can accelerate progress. Future work includes prototype fabrication, clinical validation, and iterative refinement guided by user feedback and data analytics.
